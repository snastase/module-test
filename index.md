# ReproNim: Best Practices in Reproducible Neuroimaging

**Syllabus &mdash; Fall, 2019**  
**Princeton Neuroscience Institute**

**Schedule**  
September 5 to November 14  
Thursdays, 2:30&ndash;4:00 pm

**Target audience:** Graduate students and postdocs in psychology and
neuroscience with basic programming experience.

**Prerequisites**: Make sure you have an account on the server and are
familiar with logging in. Bring your laptop!

Over the course of this training program, we’ll introduce concepts and tools
for best practices in reproducible neuroimaging computation. We’ll take a
modular, episodic approach to learning&mdash;but you’ll be expected to develop
a cumulative knowledge base and demonstrate fluency with a variety of tools.
To provide a continuous thread through all the "episodes", we’ll follow the
evolution of an example fMRI dataset from acquisition to publication. Each
episode will be accompanied by a brief reading assignment providing some
context for the lesson. At the beginning of each meeting, you'll be expected
to share the status of your current neuroimaging project, what roadblocks
you're currently facing, and how you've incorporated concepts and tools from
the previous episodes into your daily workflow.
