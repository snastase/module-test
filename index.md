# ReproNim: Best Practices in Reproducible Neuroimaging

**Syllabus &mdash; Fall, 2019**  
**Princeton Neuroscience Institute**  
Samuel A. Nastase  
snastase@princeton.edu

**Schedule**  
September 5 to November 14  
Thursdays, 2:30&ndash;4:00 pm

**Target audience:** Graduate students and postdocs with basic programming 
experience.

**Prerequisites**: Make sure you have an account on the server and are
familiar with logging in. Bring your laptop!

Over the course of this training program, we’ll introduce concepts and tools
for best practices in reproducible neuroimaging computation. We’ll take a
modular, episodic approach to learning&mdash;but you’ll be expected to develop
a cumulative knowledge base and demonstrate fluency with variety of tools. To
provide a continuous thread through all the episodes, we’ll follow the
evolution of an example fMRI dataset from acquisition to publication.

**Episode 0:** Introduction&mdash;who cares?

**Episode 1:** Basics&mdash;the shell

**Episode 2:** Basics&mdash;unit-testing

**Episode 3:** Basics&mdash;version control (Git)

**Episode 4:** Basics&mdash;version control (DataLad)

**Episode 5:** Data&mdash;the FAIR principles

**Episode 6:** Data&mdash;BIDS
